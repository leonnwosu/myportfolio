            Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate Computer Science student at 
            the University of Texas at Arlington, born on December 31, 2003, in Marietta, 
            Georgia, to two immigrant Nigerian parents. My goal is to carve my path in the world of
            game development, and Fornt End Web/App develepment. Currently, I've completed two noteworthy projects: a classic Tic Tac Toe 
            game implemented in Java and as a team member, I contributed to a base conversion game,
            also developed in Java. My proficiency extends beyond Java, encompassing HTML/CSS, JavaScript, 
            Python, C, and C++. I am well-versed in using essential tools such as Git and VSCode, along with 
            frameworks like OpenGL and Spring Boot. Join me on this exciting journey as I continue to explore and innovate 
            in the realm of computer science and game development.
